# Bunq-SDK

--Project in progress --

This the first basic part of an SDK for the bunq API.

It is possible to create and send a BunqRequest using the BunqClient.
An example for this is shown in the Test.php file using parts of the bunq coding examples to install a new device.
The test.php file is only for testing purposes and will be deleted in further versions.
NOTE: Before running the testfile: Enter the login credentials and API key.
